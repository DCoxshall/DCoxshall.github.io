Portfolio Site Host

Hello! This is my first real portfolio project. As you can see, it's in development. Just the background in place so far. The idea is that this will be a place for me to showcase my finished projects, personal and professional. As a result, this repo will probably never be "finished". 
Everything you see in this repo was coded by me, from scratch.
